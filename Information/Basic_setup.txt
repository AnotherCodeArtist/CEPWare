This document describes how to setup the whole system. Note that this approach here is only
temporary and will be replaced by NodeRED integration. Meanwhile we will use the system by means
of POSTMAN requests.

Firstly, to get the basic environment up and running you have to run the docker-compose file
with "docker-compose up" in the directory where this file is stored. The first time this can
take up to 15 Minutes.

Secondly, when the environment is up and running you have to open Postman and import the all collections.
Afterwards you have to send the requests in the order listed below.
1) Open the collection "CYGNUS_subscribe_to_ORION" and send request "POST-1_subscribe_to_ORION". This will
	enable the subscription from CYGNUS to ORION. You can check if the subscription was successful by
	sending the "GET_Check_Subsciption" request. If the status indicates "active" then the subscription
	was successful.
2) Open the collection "FLINK_subscribe_to_ORION" and send request "POST-2_subscribe_to_ORION". This will
	enable the subscription to ORION. You can check if the subscription was successful by
	sending the "GET_Check_Subsciption" request. If the status indicates "active" then the subscription
	was successful.
3) Open the collection "ORION_create_Entities" and send all requests from sensor R1 to R5 "POST_add_sensor_R1". This will
	create the entities in ORION. You can check if the entities were successfully created by
	sending the "GET_all_sensor_data" request.
4) Open the collection "IDAS_Register_ServiceGroup&Sensors" and send the requests "POST_provisioning_service_group". This will
	provision the service group in the IDAS component. Afterwards you have to send all "POST_register_sensor_RX" requests to
	register the sensors (entities) in the IDAS component.

Finally, you can use the collection "IDAS_update_Context_Data" to send requests to update the temperature to IDAS.
